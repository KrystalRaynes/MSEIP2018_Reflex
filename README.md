# MSEIP2018_Reflex
Repository containing all the files required for the day.

We will be classifying 100 flowers each with a measurement of a specfic petal/sepal.

Each row indicates a flower and each column indicates one of its petal/sepal length.

1st Column : Sepal length
2nd Column : Sepal width
3rd Column : Petal length
4th Column : Petal width
5th Column : Species (-1 for Iris Setosa, 1 for Iris Virginica)

{ 5.2, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2, -1 } 

5.2 represents the sepal length, etc.

Your goal is to create a reflex agent using Python that correctly classifies all the flowers whether it is a Iris Setoas or Iris Virginica.
