# MSEIP2018_Reflex
Repository containing all the files required for the day.

We will be classifying 100 flowers each with a measurement of a specfic petal/sepal.

Each row indicates a flower and each column indicates one of its petal/sepal length.

1st Column : Sepal length
2nd Column : Sepal width
3rd Column : Petal length
4th Column : Petal width
5th Column : Species (-1 for Iris Setosa, 1 for Iris Virginica)

{ 5.2, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2, -1 } 

5.2 represents the sepal length, etc.

Your goal is to create a reflex agent using Python that correctly classifies all the flowers whether it is a Iris Setoas or Iris Virginica.

The next dataset is if you are finished with the first one.

They are seeds that we need to classify. There are 210 seed samples.

1st Column : Area (A)
2nd Column : Perimeter (P)
3rd Column : Compactness (C = 4*pi*A/P^2)
4th Column : Kernel Length
5th Column : Kernel Width
6th Column : Assymetry Coefficient
7th Column : Kernel Groove Length
8th Column : Seed Type (1 for Kama, 2 for Rosa, 3 for Canadian)

These datasets came from UCI : Machine Learning Repository
